Javascript Memory Card Game

## What you need...

All you need is a browser to open the memory.html file and start playing Memory.  You will need to download all files from this repository and open the html file in your browser.  Without an internet connection, the text may be different but the game will still work. 

## Game Rules

The rules of the game are as follows.

* The timer starts as soon as the page loads.  Click "Restart" to restart the timer and reshuffle the cards if you'd like to start over.

* Click on any card to flip it over.  Each click is equal to half of a move.  Flip over two cards to complete a move and see if they are a match.  If they are a match, the border color on both cards will turn to yellow and the cards will stay flipped over.  If they aren't a match, the border color will turn back to red and the cards will flip back over.

* With every minute (60 seconds) that passes, you will lose a star.  You will have three stars to start out with.

* When all cards are matched, an alert will pop up and tell you how many stars you have left, how long it took you to match all cards, and the number of moves.  Click OK to play again.
